# Problem 2
Problem 2: The college Library needs to add all its books to a new index system.

Introduction
The College Library needs to implement a new index system for all its books. The objective is to automatically read book details from a stored CSV file, generate a unique index reference for each book, and write the indexed book details to a new CSV file. This project aims to demonstrate data and file handling using classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and method overloading/overriding in C#.

Requirements
Read book details (title, author, publisher, publication date) from a CSV file.
Generate a unique index reference for each book.
Write the indexed book details to a new CSV file.
Implement a separate class responsible for allocating serial numbers.
Demonstrate the use of classes and objects (encapsulation).
Utilize inheritance.
Apply polymorphism.
Incorporate method overloading/overriding (constructors count).

In this documents it will describe the designs, test plans and test results of problem 2.
