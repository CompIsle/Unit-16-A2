# Problem 2
Problem 2: The college Library needs to add all its books to a new index system.

This requires a solution that will automatically read book details (title, author, publisher, publication date) from a stored CSV file and generate unique index references before writing it to a new CSV file.

There should be a separate class responsible for allocating serial numbers through implementation of an interface to allow alternative implementations later.

This program is primarily intended to demonstrate data and file handling. 

In this documents it will describe the designs, test plans and test results of problem 2.
